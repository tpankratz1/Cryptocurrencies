# Cryptocurrencies

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, was interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. They asked for a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

A dataset was processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there was no known output for what was being looked for, unsupervised learning was used. To group the cryptocurrencies, it was decided to use a clustering algorithm. Data visualizations were used to share the findings with the bank stakeholders.

The following four technical analysis deliverables are included:

- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
